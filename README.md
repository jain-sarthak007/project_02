A Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Model
# Overview
The medical insurance cost prediction project aims to analyze various factors influencing medical expenses and develop machine learning models capable of forecasting medical costs for new policyholders. The dataset used in this project encompasses factors such as age, sex, BMI (Body Mass Index), smoking status, number of children, and region. By understanding these factors, insurance companies can make more informed decisions regarding pricing and risk assessment.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises 2.7K rows and 7 columns, including:

Age: Age of the policyholder.
Sex: Gender of the policyholder.
BMI: Body Mass Index of the policyholder.
Children: Number of children covered by the policy.
Smoker: Smoking status of the policyholder.
Region: Region of the policyholder.
Charges: Medical expenses charged to the policyholder.

# Problem Statement
This project aims to answer the following questions:

What are the primary factors influencing medical expenses?
How accurate are machine learning models in predicting medical expenses?
In what ways can machine learning models enhance the efficiency and profitability of health insurance companies?
Methodology
In this project, a linear regression machine learning model is used to predict medical expenses based on the provided features. The dataset is analyzed using various data exploration and visualization techniques to gain insights into the relationships between different factors and medical costs. Plots and charts are generated to visualize the data distributions and correlations.
